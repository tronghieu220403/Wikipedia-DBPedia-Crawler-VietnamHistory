He was born in H\u00E0 Nam Province into a family with strong ties to the revolution against French colonialism. His mother and father donated fabric and bicycles to the Vi\u1EC7t Minh. After studying the intermediate art course at the Vietnam Fine Arts College, he joined the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) in May 1965 during the heightened American bombing campaign of Operation Linebacker. First serving as a regular soldier in a missile unit, he was later sent to the Soviet Union for training and education on missile systems as a soldier and engineer. He became a war artist after his unit recognized his talent for art, and due to the army\u2019s natural demand for art. He was in charge of making banners, decorating meeting halls and drawing propaganda posters for his unit. However, he also made images for purely documentary purposes. His paintings were shown in many divisional exhibitions and published in Qu\u00E2n \u0110\u1ED9i Nh\u00E2n D\u00E2n (\u2018People\u2019s Army\u2019 newspaper). Many of his images involved scenes of ant-aircraft defenses. He was able to draw in many famous locations, including the Ho Chi Minh Trail, Highway 9, Khe Sanh, the Second Battle of Qu\u1EA3ng Tr\u1ECB and eventually in Saigon in 1975 during and after liberation. He graduated the Vietnam Fine Arts College in 1976. In the same year, his painting Evening on the Red River was given to the Cuban government. He remained in the PAVN until 1990, working with them to reorganize museums and art exhibitions. He also painted from his recollections of the Vietnam War and his work was included in many exhibitions throughout Vietnam." , "lang" : "en" } ] ,    "http://dbpedia.org/ontology/wikiPageWikiLink" : [ { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Second_Battle_of_Qu\u1EA3ng_Tr\u1ECB" } ,      { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1945_births" } ,      { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://dbpedia.org/resource/People's_Army_of_Vietnam" } ,      { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Operation_Linebacker" } ,      { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soviet_Union" } ,      { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Khe_Sanh" } ,      { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vi\u1EC7t_Minh" } ,      { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_colonialism" } ,      { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:People's_Army_of_Vietnam" } ,      { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://dbpedia.org/resource/H\u00E0_Nam_Province" } ,      { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Vietnamese_artists" } ,      { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vietnam_War" } ,      { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:North_Vietnamese_people" } ,      { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:People_from__H\u00E0_Nam_Province" } ,      { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Vietnam_War_artists" } ,      { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ho_Chi_Minh_City_Museum_of_Fine_Arts" } ,      { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vietnam_Fine_Arts_College" } ,      { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vietnam_National_Museum_of_Fine_Arts" } ,      { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saigon" } ,      { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Second_Indochina_War" } ,      { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ho_Chi_Minh_trail" } ,      { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Living_people" } ,      { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Qu\u00E2n_\u0110\u1ED9i_Nh\u00E2n_D\u00E2n" } ] ,    "http://dbpedia.org/property/wikiPageUsesTemplate" : [ { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:Reflist" } ] ,    "http://dbpedia.org/ontology/wikiPageRevisionID" : [ { "type" : "literal", "value" : 1058215011 , "datatype" : "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer" } ] ,    "http://dbpedia.org/ontology/wikiPageExternalLink" : [ { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://hoimythuattphcm.vn/hoa-si-nguyen-duc-tho-2/" } ,      { "type" : "uri", "value" : "https://research.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx%3FobjectId=178246&page=11&partId=1&peoA=137931-3-14&people=137931" } ,      { "type" : "uri", "value" : "https://witnesscollection.com/project/nguyen-duc-tho/" } ] ,    "http://dbpedia.org/ontology/wikiPageLength" : [ { "type" : "literal", "value" : "4151" , "datatype" : "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#nonNegativeInteger" } ] ,    "http://dbpedia.org/ontology/wikiPageID" : [ { "type" : "literal", "value" : 63009892 , "datatype" : "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer" } ] ,    "http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#sameAs" : [ { "type" : "uri", "value" : "https://global.dbpedia.org/id/BuJ9J" } ,      { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q87493350" } ,      { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nguy\u1EC5n_\u00D0\u1EE9c_Th\u1ECD" } ] ,    "http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#wasDerivedFrom" : [ { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguy\u1EC5n_\u00D0\u1EE9c_Th\u1ECD?oldid=1058215011&ns=0" } ] ,    "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/isPrimaryTopicOf" : [ { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguy\u1EC5n_\u00D0\u1EE9c_Th\u1ECD" } ] } ,  "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witness_Collection" : { "http://dbpedia.org/ontology/wikiPageWikiLink" : [ { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nguy\u1EC5n_\u00D0\u1EE9c_Th\u1ECD" } ] } ,  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguy\u1EC5n_\u00D0\u1EE9c_Th\u1ECD" : { "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/primaryTopic" : [ { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nguy\u1EC5n_\u00D0\u1EE9c_Th\u1ECD" } ] } ,  "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nguyen_Duc_Tho" : { "http://dbpedia.org/ontology/wikiPageWikiLink" : [ { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nguy\u1EC5n_\u00D0\u1EE9c_Th\u1ECD" } ] ,    "http://dbpedia.org/ontology/wikiPageRedirects" : [ { "type" : "uri", "value" : "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nguy\u1EC5n_\u00D0\u1EE9c_Th\u1ECD" } ] }}
